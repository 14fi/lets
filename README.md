# LETS
### Fork of RealistikOsu's fork of Ainu's fork of osufx's fork of lets by Ripple

This is the current code used for osuHOW's /web endpoint (score server), it will soon be depricated in favour of [USSR](https://github.com/RealistikOsu/USSR).

You really shouldn't be using this if you're looking for code to run your own server as it's fairly difficult to work with.

Also, please don't ask me how to get this running, i won't help you.
